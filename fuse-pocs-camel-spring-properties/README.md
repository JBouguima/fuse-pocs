JBoss Fuse proof of concept - Using OSGi Compendium Configuration Admin Service in Camel Spring module
=========

In this example I demonstrate how to use
[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/cm/ConfigurationAdmin.html](OSGi Compendium Configuration Admin
Service) in Camel Spring module. The example is verified by companion Pax Exam tests.

In order to execute this proof of concept just execute the following command in fuse-pocs-camel-spring-properties
directory:

    mvn install
